# Advanced Software Modeling and Design - Reinforcement Learning Project

This project is part of the **Advanced Software Modeling and Design** exam, exploring different approaches to Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementation and optimization.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of a multi-agent reinforcement learning system, developed through three distinct phases of refinement and improvement.

## Documentation Sections

### 1. [Grid Q-Learning](gridqlearning/)
The initial approach to the problem, implementing a basic Q-Learning algorithm on a grid-based environment. This section covers the foundational concepts and the first implementation of the reinforcement learning solution.

### 2. [Visual Q-Learning](visualqlearning/)
A refined approach that introduces visual elements and improved learning mechanisms. This section documents the second iteration of the project, focusing on enhanced visualization and learning efficiency.

### 3. [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)](marl/)
The final and most advanced implementation, featuring multi-agent systems and sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques. This section presents the culmination of the project with advanced RL concepts and implementations.

### 4. [LLM Q-Learning Extensions](llmqlearning/)
An innovative extension to the MARL framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent Q-Table generation. This section demonstrates how AI can be used to bootstrap reinforcement learning with pre-computed optimal policies.
