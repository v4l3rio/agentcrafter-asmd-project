# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

This section documents the final and most advanced phase of our reinforcement learning project, implementing sophisticated multi-agent systems with complex interaction dynamics and coordination mechanisms.

## Overview

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) represents the culmination of our project evolution, addressing the limitations of single-agent approaches by introducing multiple learning agents that can interact, compete, and cooperate within shared environments. This implementation showcases advanced RL concepts and demonstrates the complexity of multi-agent systems.

## Key Concepts

### Multi-Agent Systems
MARL extends traditional reinforcement learning to environments with multiple autonomous agents, each with their own learning objectives and policies. The key challenges include:
- **Non-stationarity**: The environment appears non-stationary from each agent's perspective
- **Coordination**: Agents must learn to coordinate their actions
- **Competition vs Cooperation**: Balancing individual and collective objectives
- **Scalability**: Managing complexity as the number of agents increases

### Agent Interaction Paradigms
- **Cooperative**: Agents work together toward common goals
- **Competitive**: Agents compete for limited resources or conflicting objectives
- **Mixed-Motive**: Combination of cooperative and competitive elements
- **Independent**: Agents learn independently without explicit coordination

## Advanced Algorithms

### Multi-Agent Q-Learning Variants

#### Independent Q-Learning (IQL)
- Each agent learns independently using standard Q-Learning
- Treats other agents as part of the environment
- Simple but may not converge in multi-agent settings

#### Multi-Agent Deep Q-Networks (MADQN)
- Extension of DQN to multi-agent scenarios
- Centralized training with decentralized execution
- Shared experience replay and coordinated learning

#### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG)
- Actor-critic method for continuous action spaces
- Centralized critics with decentralized actors
- Handles mixed cooperative-competitive scenarios
