# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

The **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** framework is the core foundation of the AgentCrafter project. It provides a sophisticated, DSL-based approach to defining and executing multi-agent reinforcement learning simulations with advanced coordination mechanisms.

## Overview

This framework represents the culmination of reinforcement learning evolution in the project, implementing a powerful Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that allows for intuitive definition of complex multi-agent scenarios with cooperative behaviors, environmental interactions, and advanced learning strategies.

## Architecture Overview

The MARL framework is built on a sophisticated multi-agent coordination architecture that enables complex cooperative behaviors and learning strategies.

### Multi-Agent Coordination Architecture

The system enables multiple agents to coordinate through triggers, effects, and shared world state, with Q-Learning components working together in a multi-agent environment.

## Key Concepts

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Cooperative Learning**: Multiple agents working together to achieve shared objectives
- **Trigger Systems**: Environmental switches and triggers that require agent coordination
- **Shared State Management**: Synchronized state updates across multiple learning agents
- **Dynamic Interactions**: Real-time agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment interactions

### Advanced Learning Mechanisms
- **Q-Learning with Coordination**: Enhanced Q-Learning that considers multi-agent interactions
- **Configurable Parameters**: Flexible learning rates, exploration strategies, and reward structures
- **Policy Optimization**: Advanced algorithms for optimal policy discovery in multi-agent settings
- **Experience Sharing**: Mechanisms for agents to learn from each other's experiences

### Environment Complexity
- **Grid-Based Worlds**: Sophisticated 2D environments with walls, obstacles, and interactive elements
- **Trigger Mechanisms**: Switches, buttons, and conditional elements requiring coordination
- **Dynamic Rewards**: Context-aware reward systems that adapt to multi-agent behaviors
- **Scalable Scenarios**: Support for varying numbers of agents and environment complexities

## DSL Architecture

### Core DSL Components

The MARL framework is built around a powerful Scala 3 DSL that provides:

```scala
// Simulation Configuration
simulation(
  name = "CooperativeScenario",
  width = 10,
  height = 10,
  episodes = 1000
) {
  // Agent definitions with learning parameters
  agent("Agent1") {
    position = (0, 0)
    learningRate = 0.1
    explorationRate = 0.3
  }
  
  agent("Agent2") {
    position = (9, 9)
    learningRate = 0.1
    explorationRate = 0.3
  }
  
  // Environmental elements
  walls {
    line(from = (2, 0), to = (2, 5))
    line(from = (7, 4), to = (7, 9))
  }
  
  // Coordination triggers
  trigger("Switch1") {
    position = (3, 3)
    requiresAgents = 2
    reward = 100
  }
}
```

### Property System

The DSL uses a sophisticated property system with the following enums:

- **SimulationProperty**: `Penalty`, `Episodes`, `Steps`, `ShowAfter`, `Delay`, `WithGUI`
- **AgentProperty**: `Name`, `Start`, `Goal`
- **LearnerProperty**: `Alpha`, `Gamma`, `Eps0`, `EpsMin`, `Warm`, `Optimistic`
- **TriggerProperty**: `Give`, `OpenWall`, `EndEpisode`
- **WallProperty**: `Line`, `Block`
- **LineProperty**: `Direction`, `From`, `To`
- **WallLLMProperty**: `Model`, `Prompt`

### Configuration Classes

The framework uses type-safe configuration classes:

```scala
case class LearnerConfig(
  learningRate: Double = 0.1,
  discountFactor: Double = 0.9,
  explorationRate: Double = 0.1,
  explorationDecay: Double = 0.995
)

case class LineWallConfig(
  from: (Int, Int),
  to: (Int, Int)
)
```
